# How to deploy Graviton based EC2 instances via GUI
Log in to your AWS account and open the EC2 Dashboard. To launch an instance, select Launch instance from the Dashboard.

## Name and Tags
Name the instance.

## Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
Here we can select an Ubuntu AMI and change the architecture to Arm.

Also select "64-bit (Arm)" from Architecture drop down

## Choose an Instance Type
For instance type, we select an Arm based t4g.nano instance as shown below. More information on Arm based Graviton instance types can be found on the [AWS Graviton page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/).

## SSH Key pair
We can use a key pair to securely connect to our instance. We can choose from an existing key pair, or create a new one. It is generally preferred that instead of using the same key pair for all instances, you should create a new one for different groups of instances.

For creating a new Key pair Go to > **Create a new pair** and then name it (e.g. demoserver). Then select the key type and format and press **Create key pair**

Download the newly created Key Pair. Once it is downloaded, we can select it from the drop down list.

## Network setting
Use the default VPC and Subnet.

## Configure Security Group
We can choose an existing security group or we can create a new security group. Below, we show how to create a new security group that allows SSH access to the        instance.

## Configure Storage
By default, EC2 instances come with 8GiB of storage. You may want to increase this for scenarios that require log files and backups. In our case, we selected 25GiB of storage. Selecting a volume type of General Purpose SSD (gp2) is a good starting point. You can explore the different storage options after you understand the nature of your workload better.

Set Delete On Termination to yes. This will ensure that the volume is deleted and will not incur charges on you account once the instance is terminated.
   
## Review and Launch
Check the details in the summary box and press launch.

## SSH into the launched instance
We can login into created instance using SSH. To do that, we require access to the key pair (Pem file) which we have downloaded. By default, pem file permission is set to `rw-r--r--`. This is not allowed for SSH Pem files. We have to change the permission for this Pem file to 400, so that only the current user can read this Pem file.

```
$ chmod 400 demoserver.pem
```
   
Now, only the owner of the Pem file can read it. In fact, these are permissions that a Pem file expects. Select the Instance by checking the box of the instance you want to connect to and GO TO Â» connect.

Here in SSH Client, you will see instructions that explain how to SSH into the instance.

If in your terminal, you are in the same directory where the Pem file is present. you will not need the full path for the pem file. Use following command to ssh an instance:
   
```
ssh -i "demoserver.pem" ubuntu@<Public IP/DNS address>
```
