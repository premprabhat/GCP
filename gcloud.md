# How to deploy Graviton based EC2 instances with Terraform
This guide will show how to deploy a Graviton based EC2 instance using Terraform.

## Prerequisite
* An [installation of Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/cli/install/apt).
* An AWS account.
* An installation of [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).
      
      
## Generate Access keys (access key ID and secret access key)
The installation of Terraform on your desktop or laptop needs to communicate with AWS. Thus, Terraform needs to be able to authenticate with AWS. For authentication, we need to generate access keys (access key ID and secret access key). These access keys are used by Terraform for making programmatic calls to AWS via the AWS CLI.
  
### Go to My Security Credentials

### On Your Security Credentials page click on create access keys (access key ID and secret access key)

### Copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

## Generate key-pair(public key, private key) using ssh keygen

### Generate the public key and private key
Before using Terraform, we need to first generate the key-pair(public key, private key) using ssh-keygen. Then we are going to associate both public and private keys with AWS EC2 instances.

Generate the key-pair using the following command:
 
      $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
       
By default, the above command will generate the public as well as private key at location **/home/.ssh**. But we can override the end destination with a custom path (Eg: /home/ubuntu/aws/ followed by key name aws_keys).
Output when a key pair is generated:

**Note:** We have to use public key aws_keys.pub inside the Terraform file to provision/start the instance and private key aws_keys to connect to instance.

## Create your first Terraform infrastructure (main.tf)
Before we start writing Terraform script, the first thing to learn over here is - we need to save our configuration with **.tf** extension. We will start by     creating an empty main.tf file.
   
### Provider
We need to tell Terraform which cloud provider we are going to connect e.g - AWS, Google, or Azure
As this article is focused on AWS, so we are going to mention AWS as our provider.
Here is the basic syntax for the provider
      
      resource "<PROVIDER>_<TYPE>" "<NAME>" {
      [CONFIG …]
      }
      
1. "PROVIDER_TYPE" - aws, google
2. "NAME" - You can define your name
   
This is how our main.tf will look like for AWS -
   
      provider "aws" {
      region     = "eu-central-1"
      access_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
      secret_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
      } 
      
### Resource - "aws_instance"
Next, after defining the provider, we are going to define the resource. Resource is something that we are going to provision/start on AWS. We are going to provision an EC2 instance on AWS.
But before we provision the EC2 instance, we need to gather a few points -
   
1. **ami** = you need to tell Terraform which AMI(Amazon Machine Image) you are going to use. Is it going to be Ubuntu, CentOS or something else
2. **instance_type** = Also based on your need you have to choose the instance_type and it can be t4g.nano, t4g.micro, t4g.small etc.

### How to find ami(Amazon Machine Image)
1. To find the correct ami you need to Goto >> **EC2**

2. In the left Navigation you will find **Images -> AMIs**

3. On the search menu click on public images and then apply filters as per your reuirment. e.g. architecture=arm64, platform=ubuntu.
copy the AMI ID from the search result.

### How to find correct instance_type
We can find the correct ìnstance_type by visiting [this page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).
Since I am looking for a very basic instance_type not production level instance, so I choose **t4g.nano**
Here is the aws_instance configuration -
   
      resource "aws_instance" "ec2_example" {
      ami = "ami-02a92e06fd643c11b"  
      instance_type = "t4g.nano" 
      key_name= "aws_key"
      vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.main.id]
      }

#### Here is our complete main.tf -
    
         provider "aws" {
            region     = "us-east-2"
            access_key = "Axxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
            secret_key = "JzZKiCia2vjbq4zGGGxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
         }

         resource "aws_instance" "ec2_example" {
            ami = "ami-02a92e06fd643c11b"  
            instance_type = "t4g.nano" 
            key_name= "aws_key"
            vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.main.id]

            provisioner "remote-exec" {
               inline = [
               "touch hello.txt",
               "echo helloworld remote provisioner >> hello.txt",
               ]
            }
             provisioner "local-exec" {
               command = "echo ${self.private_ip} >> private_ips.txt && echo ${self.public_ip} >> public_ips.txt && echo ${self.public_dns} >> public_ips.txt"
               }
            connection {
               type        = "ssh"
               host        = self.public_ip
               user        = "ubuntu"
               private_key = file("/home/ubuntu/aws/aws_key")
               timeout     = "4m"
            }
         }

         resource "aws_security_group" "main" {
            egress = [
              {
               cidr_blocks      = [ "0.0.0.0/0", ]
               description      = ""
               from_port        = 0
               ipv6_cidr_blocks = []
               prefix_list_ids  = []
               protocol         = "-1"
               security_groups  = []
               self             = false
               to_port          = 0
              }
            ]
             ingress = [
              {
                cidr_blocks      = [ "0.0.0.0/0", ]
                description      = ""
                from_port        = 22
                ipv6_cidr_blocks = []
                prefix_list_ids  = []
                protocol         = "tcp"
                security_groups  = []
                self             = false
                to_port          = 22
              }
            ]
         }

         resource "aws_key_pair" "deployer" {
            key_name   = "aws_key"
            public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDbvRN/gvQBhFe+dE8p3Q865T/xTKgjqTjj56p1IIKbq8SDyOybE8ia0rMPcBLAKds+wjePIYpTtRxT9UsUbZJTgF+SGSG2dC6+ohCQpi6F3xM7ryL9fy3BNCT5aPrwbR862jcOIfv     7R1xVfH8OS0WZa8DpVy5kTeutsuH5suehdngba4KhYLTzIdhM7UKJvNoUMRBaxAqIAThqH9Vt/iR1WpXgazoPw6dyPssa7ye6tUPRipmPTZukfpxcPlsqytXWlXm7R89xAY9OXkdPPVsrQdkdfhnY8aFb9XaZP8cm7EOVRdxMsA1DyWMVZOTjhBwCHfEIGoePAS3jFMqQjGWQd rahul@rahul-HP-ZBook-15-G2"
         }                  

#### NOTE : "Key_name" & "Public_key" should be replaced with original value. 
       
## Terraform commands
    
### Initialize Terraform
Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform deployment. This command is responsible for downloading all the dependencies which are required for the provider AWS.
```
  terraform init
```

### Create a Terraform execution plan
Run `terraform plan` to create an execution plan.
```
  terraform plan
```
**NOTE:** The **terraform plan** command is optional. We can directly run **terraform apply** command. But it is always better to check the resources about to be created.

### Apply a Terraform execution plan
Run `terraform apply` to apply the execution plan to your cloud infrastructure. Below command creates all required infrastructure.
```
  terraform apply
```

### Verify the EC2 setup
Let's verify the setup by going back to the AWS console.
Goto **EC2 -> instances** you should see the instance running.

You can also see the tag name - Terraform EC2, which we mentioned in the Terraform script.
   
### Use private key 'aws_key' to SSH into EC2 instance
In the previous step, we have started the EC2 instance. Now we need to connect to the EC2 instance using the private key.
You can find the connect command from the aws console-

### Clean up resources
Run `terraform destroy` to delete all resources created.
```
  terraform destroy
```
It will remove all resource groups, virtual networks, and all other resources created through Terraform.
